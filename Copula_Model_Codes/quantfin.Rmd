# Contract Price Modelling Approaches :

Contract modelling approaches for commodity prices are pivotal in the commodity market's intricate ecosystem. These approaches aim to decipher and predict price dynamics, enabling informed decision-making for traders and stakeholders. By employing various techniques such as statistical models, time series analysis, and derivatives pricing methods, these approaches provide a lens into the behavior of commodity prices within the market's ever-evolving landscape. Through insightful modelling, market participants gain valuable insights into price movements, aiding risk mitigation and strategic planning.

## Mean-Reverting Process : 

To value derivatives, we are often interested in modeling the spot price of a commodity in the traditional risk neutral world. Under this risk neutral world the commodity price $S$ follows the following equation for Mean-Reversion process.   

$$d\ln(S)=[\theta(t) - a\ln(S)]dt + \sigma\ dz$$
Where, $\{Z_t\}_{t > 0}$ is Wiener process. 

Most of the pricing models assume mean reverting processes.There are intuitive reasons for this. As the price of a source of energy rises, it is likely to be consumed less and produced more. This creates a downward pressure on process. As the price of a source of energy declines, it is likely to be consumed more, but production is likely to be less economically viable. This creates upward pressure on the price. To construct an approximate solution trinomial tree can be used. It is used to determine the value of $\theta(t)$ under some constraints.

```

## Jump Models : 

Commodities like Electricity, Natural gas exhibit price jumps because pf weather related demand shocks. This is true for agricultural products as well. Jumps can be incorporated in the equation of mean reverting process by the following modification.


$$d\ln(S)=[\theta(t) - a\ln(S)]dt + \sigma\ dz + dp$$
Where, $dp$ is the Poisson Process generating the percentage jumps. This is similar to Merton's mixed jump-diffusion model for stock prices. Once the jump frequency and jump size probability distribution have been chosen, the average increase in the commodity price at a future time $t$ that is as a result of jumps can be calculated. To determine $\theta(t)$, the trinomial tree method can be used with the futures prices for maturity $t$ reduced by this increase.

```

## Other Models :

More sophisticated models are sometimes used for oil prices. If $y$ is the convenience yield, then the proportional drift of the spot price is $r - y$,where $r$ is the short-term risk-free rate and a natural process ti assume for the spot price is - 

$$\frac{dS}{S} = (r-y)dt + \sigma_1\ dz_1$$
Gibson and Schwartz suggest that the convenience yield $y$ be modeled as a mean reverting process.

$$dy = k(\alpha - y)dt  + \sigma_2 \ dz_2$$
Where $k$ and $\alpha$ are constants and $dz_2$ is a Weiner process, which is correlated with the Weiner process $dz_1$. To provide an exact fit to futures prices, $\alpha$ cab be made a function of time. 
Eyedeland and Geman propose a stochastic volatility for electricity prices. Which is - 

$$\frac{dS}{S} = a(b - ln(S))dt + \sqrt{V}dz_1$$
$$dV = c(d - V)dt +  e\sqrt{V}dz_2$$
Where $a,b,c,d$ and $e$ are constants and $dz_1$ and $dz_2$ are correlated Weiner processes. Later German proposed a model for oil where the reversion level $b$ is also stochastic.
